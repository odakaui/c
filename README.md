# C

This is the README for `c`.
It's also the documentation and the user manual.

`c` is a small program that was designed to do one thing.
Count.

No, that's not right. 

`c` is a small program written in rust that was designed to do one thing.
Count up.

Much better.

Yes, you read that right.
`c` can only count up.

Not down.
Not sideways.
Up.

## What is c Used For?

The use case for `c` is simple.

Say you are a developer working on Quantum Blockchain technology.
You've put thousands of hours into the project, only to realize that you have a serious problem on your hands. 
You don't know how many times the earth orbits the sun per day.

Instead of using a search engine to look up the information like normie pleb, you whip up a constellation of surveillance cubesats to monitor the earth for you.
Then, using your 1337 h4x0r s|<1llz you create a python script to download and process the information *ahem* data you receive from them. 

But, this leaves you with one final problem.
What do you do with all of this informati-- I mean, data?

You could input it into a spreadsheet by hand.
You could spend $50,000 and hire a secretary to input it into a spreadsheet for you. 
Or, you could use `c`, a small and lightweight program written in rust, that is purpose built for this exact scenario. 

## Usage

Now that you know __what__ `c` is used for, let me teach you __how__ to use it. 

Sporting only five commands, `c` has a simple user interface.

First, you create an event using the command `c add [PROJECT_NAME]`.
Then, you create another event using command `c add [PROJECT_NAME]`.
Finally, you create yet another event using command `c add [PROJECT_NAME]`.

If you mess up, you can use `c rm [HASH]` to quickly hide the evidence.
The hash that corresponds to your crim-- I mean, mistake can be found with `c list [PROJECT_NAME]`.

If you don't know what a hash is, it looks like this `42069420` except different.
Hopefully.

Of course, `c` wouldn't be `c` without the ability to display the number of events added to the database for a given project (the count).
This functionality can be unlocked with the command `c count [PROJECT_NAME]`.

Finally, for power users only, `c` has one additional command.

`c list-projects` does exactly what might imagine it does. 
It prints out a list of the names of every project in the database.

## Caveats

Before I bid you farewell, there are several caveats that I must disclose. 

* `c` has no error handling, which means it shouldn't be used in mission critical applications like scalping GPUs or monitoring your mining rigs. 
* `c` stores its database in `$HOME/.local/share/c/c.db`. I'm too lazy to implement a config file parser or environment variable reader, so if you want to change this path you'll have to dive into the source code. 

That's all I can think of.
For now...
